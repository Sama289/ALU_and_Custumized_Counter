# ALU_and_Custumized_Counter
Our Logic design course project aims to design, simulate, and implement a digital circuit to count a number sequence &amp; display it on a 7-segment display. includes the architecture and external Interface forms, where the focused on developing a tailored architecture to perform a specific function .
• Phase 1:

Design and implement your own arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) that will have two
inputs A and B (4-bits each). Your circuit will enable the user to select which function
to perform. The suggested operations are as follows:

o A + B
o A – B
o A * B
o A/B
o A and B
o A or B
o Complement A
o Increment A

Your output will be displayed using seven segment display.

• Phase 2:

We Design a sequential circuit with D-type flip-flops and logic gates to
count the sequence: 0, 3,1, 2, 7, 4, 6, back to 0, and repeat; then display it
